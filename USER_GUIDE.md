## ✨ The Coda Experience

### 🌊 Fluid & Glass
Coda AI utilizes a modern **Glassmorphism** design system. Navigation headers, input fields, and priority sheets use real-time Gaussian blur effects to provide depth and focus, ensuring your content remains the centerpiece of the experience.

### ⚡ Instant Perception (Splash)
Every launch of Coda AI is met with a high-fidelity **Precision Splash**. This isn't just a loading screen; it's a recalibration of the "Coda Core," ensuring your local environment is ready for instant responses.

3. **Session Intelligence**: Use the **Gear Icon** inside any chat to access model switching (**Pro vs. Flash**) and advanced summarization tools.

### 💡 Proactive Tooling

*   **Recursive Prompting**: The **"Use as Prompt"** button turns any AI response into a platform for your next instruction. This creates a powerful feedback loop for high-fidelity creative output.
