## ✨ The Premium Native Experience

### 🌊 Full-Screen Immersion
Coda AI is optimized for the latest iPhone displays. It respects the **Safe Area** (notches and home indicators), providing a seamless edge-to-edge glassmorphism interface that feels integrated into the operating system.

### 📳 Tactile Response (Haptics)
Unlike web apps, Coda AI speaks to your senses. We've integrated the **iOS Haptic Engine** to provide subtle, physical confirmation for:
- Sending messages.
- Creating and identifying Labs.
- Deleting workspaces or sessions.

### 🚀 Instant Awakening (Splash)
The app features a custom **Native Splash Screen**. Every time you tap the Coda icon, the app performs a silent handshake with your local database while providing a premium visual transition.

## 🏛️ Mastering Your Workspaces

1. **Contextual Project Labs**: Filter your sessions using the horizontal category picker.
2. **Infinite Creation**: Tap the **Compose Icon** or use the bottom bar to spin up new threads.
3. **Session & Lab Management**: Tap **Edit** to enter a sovereign management mode (move sessions, rename labs, or purge data).
4. **Native Dialogs**: All confirmations use standard iOS system alerts, ensuring a familiar and secure feel.

### 🎙️ Proactive Voice UI
