## 💡 Smart Interaction Features

### Smart Prompt Starters
On any empty chat screen, you'll see quick-start suggestions. These are designed to help you get the best out of the AI with a single tap.

### Contextual Follow-up Chips
After the AI responds, look for horizontal "chips" above the keyboard. These allow you to quickly refine the conversation:
- **"Ask for examples"**: Deep dive into the current topic.
- **"Shorten this"**: Get a condensed version of the long response.
- **"Turn into an email"**: Instantly draft a professional email based on the chat.

### Use as Prompt
Found a great response you want to tweak? Tap **"Use as Prompt"** at the bottom of any AI message. It will copy the text into your input field so you can edit and resend it.
